Here is the main part of my application.

It contains the app.py which can be run manually or used using WSGI.

The config.py and lost_config.json supply it the necessary information to start the application.

Templates hold all my html and layouts.

Static is for bootstrap and minimal CSS styling. 

wsgi_migration is a simple script that moves everything to WSGI and restarts the Apache server.
