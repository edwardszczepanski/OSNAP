	 * Much of the design of this schema is coming directly from earlier assignments. Although
	 * the LOST database schema is no longer being enforced I still think it is a good idea to
	 * follow much of the same principles. I may have to remove some stuff in the future.
	 * This has been updated for revision #3. After last assignment I had some technical debt so that was difficult to fix. Not so much here, but in my SQL queries. I had a location foreign key in assets, which doesn't really make sense... Fixed now.
	 * I made my requests and in_transit two separate tables. in_transit is associated with requests. It is a one-to-one relationship. Pretty simple. All in_transit holds really is start and end dates.
	 * Requests holds most of the information. I think it is a pretty solid data model.
